# Side Projects
Here are some interesting side projects that I've worked on.

**Election-2020**: A R Notebook exploring real-time voting records from the 2020 American Presidential election in light of claims about Biden "stealing" the election.
**Pomodoro.R**: Programming a pomodoro timer in R, which includes goals with each working interval and records them in a .csv file.
